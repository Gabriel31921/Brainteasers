# Brainteasers
A recopilation of brainteasers I find and resolve.

Brainteaser 1:<br>
"Three people choose numbers from 1 to 100. The first person chooses randomly, following a uniform distribution, while the second and third choose their numbers rationally. The person who chooses the highest number has to pay the other two the amount they chose. You are the second person—what number do you choose? Keep in mind that you won’t know which numbers the others have chosen before making your decision."

Brainteaser 2:<br>
"You assist to the auction of a painting, you win the auction if your bid is higher than the painting value, and if you win, you have contacted a museum that will buy the painting for 1,5 times the actual value of the painting, so, how much will you bid?"
