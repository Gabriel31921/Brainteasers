# Brainteasers
A recopilation of brainteasers I find and resolve.

Brainteaser 1:
"Three people choose numbers from 1 to 100. The first person chooses randomly, following a uniform distribution, while the second and third choose their numbers rationally. The person who chooses the highest number has to pay the other two the amount they chose. You are the second person—what number do you choose? Keep in mind that you won’t know which numbers the others have chosen before making your decision."
